# Salary Calculator 

An application that will take information on an employee(s) and adds up salaries to report total monthly costs.

## Description

Duration: Weekend Project

The Salary Calculator will total all employees in the table and return the the monthly cost of those employees.  If the total cost exceeds 20,000 the output at the bottom (Monthly Cost:) will change background to red.

It was a challenge to implement a remove employee button that would remove a specific employee from the array of employees and re-render the DOM.  I was able to accomplish this by placing the remove employee button in with the employee ID.  Each employee should have a unique ID so the remove button matches to the employee id that it is next to and only removes that employee from the employees array.  

I used html css javascript and jquery to build this applicaton.

You can run this application in your web browser.
